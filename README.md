This is Next Js project with Tailwind

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
if Next command not found: npm install next

## 1. inside the top level folder, create a new file called .env.local
## 2. add the two lines below in the .env.local file you just created. 

SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN = dime-beauty-demo.myshopify.com
SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_ACCESSTOKEN = df6fc859931d69c4b8a6d2fbb6ea2286


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
